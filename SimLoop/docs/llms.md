# Index for AI agents

A flat index of this site. Every page, what is on it, and when to read it — so an agent can go straight to
the right page instead of crawling navigation.

**SimLoop** is a season-agnostic JVM simulation library for FIRST Tech Challenge robot code. Package root
`org.horizon36596.simloop`. Version `0.1.0-beta1`. Licence AGPL-3.0-or-later: you may use and modify it freely, but if you distribute your robot code or anything else built on it, that must be AGPL-3.0 too. Using it privately, without distributing, carries no such obligation. Not yet published.

## Read this first

- **[What it does not do](limits.md)** — the authoritative list of what is out of scope. If a task needs
  something on that list, there is no API for it; say so rather than searching. Contact physics, vision,
  field geometry, command scheduling, controller tuning and calibration are all out of scope.

## Pages

| Page | Contains | Read it when |
|---|---|---|
| [What SimLoop is](index.md) | The idea, the package table, the four rules the module holds itself to. | Orienting. |
| [Installing it](getting-started.md) | The complete Gradle change: both repository lines, the dependency, the JUnit 5 switch, and the `publishToMavenLocal` route that works while the coordinate does not. | Writing or fixing a build file. |
| [Your first simulated test](first-test.md) | A complete runnable test — fake motor, plant, controller, scenario, scored result. The same file runs in CI. | Writing a first test, or a template for any test. |
| [What it does not do](limits.md) | Every deliberate boundary, with the reason, plus known rough edges. | Before planning anything; before claiming a feature exists. |
| [Packages overview](packages/index.md) | Which package does what and how they connect. | Choosing where a thing lives. |
| [`fakehardware`](packages/fakehardware.md) | Fake SDK devices and `FakeHardwareMap`. Ticks, volts, `[-1, 1]` power. | Wiring hardware into a test. |
| [`plant`](packages/plant.md) | First-order mechanism and drivetrain models: time constant, max speed, end stops, gravity fraction. Drivetrain pose is in the **localizer frame**: +x forward, +y left, CCW-positive. | Modelling motion, or explaining a response. |
| [`config`](packages/config.md) | The interfaces the season implements. Full unit table per method. The two defaults that quietly lie. | Writing a robot's sim config. |
| [`sim`](packages/sim.md) | `FakeTimer`, `ScenarioRunner`, `RlogDecodedCompare`. The four reasons a run refuses to return a log. | Running a scenario, or diagnosing a thrown run. |
| [`field`](packages/field.md) | Game pieces, possession states, trigger volumes, and `FieldFrameTransform` — the rotation between the drivetrain's frame and the field's. Intake *logic*, not intaking. | Modelling possession, or crossing between the two frames. |
| [`loop`](packages/loop.md) | `RunResult`, `Objective`, `Guardrail`, `Scorer`, `Gate`, `LoopDriver`, `StopReport`. | Scoring a run or driving iteration. |
| [`viz`](packages/viz.md) | Mechanism sketches for AdvantageScope. Inches, radians, robot frame. | Drawing a mechanism's pose. |
| [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) | Failures that read like a robot-code bug and are not. | A build or run failed. |
| [Reporting a bug](support.md) | Where issues go, and what a complete report contains. | Filing something. |

## Facts worth having without opening a page

- **Log keys gain a prefix.** `Logger.recordOutput("A/b", x)` is read back as `"RealOutputs/A/b"`.
  Querying the unprefixed key throws `MetricNotFoundException`, never returns zero.
- **Tick order is read, decide, command, then `plant.update(deltaTime)`.** Updating first delays every
  response one tick.
- **Time is always seconds.** `deltaTime` is the scenario's fixed step; 0.02 s is the usual 50 Hz.
- **Mechanism position units are the caller's choice** and nothing converts. Drivetrain pose is always
  inches and radians.
- **There are two frames, ninety degrees apart, and both are deliberate.** `plant` integrates a
  drivetrain pose in the **localizer frame** (+x forward, +y left); `field` places game pieces in the
  **field frame** (+X right, +Y forward). Convert with
  `org.horizon36596.simloop.field.FieldFrameTransform` — `fieldXFromLocalizer`, `fieldYFromLocalizer`,
  `fieldHeadingFromLocalizer`, and the three inverses. Rotation only, no translation; heading *rates*
  are not rotated. Nothing calls it for you, and passing a pose across unrotated returns a confident
  wrong answer rather than throwing.
- **Gravity fraction is always positive**, unitless, in `[0, 1)`. The plant subtracts it, so gravity always
  pulls toward `minPosition`.
- **`UNKNOWN` is a real guardrail verdict** and is not a pass. Read `Scorer.Score.unknowns()` before
  trusting a score.
- **SimLoop never imports season code.** Facts reach it only through the `config` interfaces.
- **SimLoop is a `testImplementation` dependency.** Nothing in it is meant to run on a Control Hub.
- **The API reference** is generated by `./gradlew :SimLoop:apiDocs` and ships as
  `SimLoop-<version>-javadoc.jar`. Every public member carries units and frame; that is enforced by the
  build, not by convention.
