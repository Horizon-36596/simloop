/**
 * Kinematic mecanum forward-kinematics pose integrator (architecture §3 core primitive,
 * fakehardware-plant §5). Given the four wheel linear speeds (in/s) it computes chassis velocity,
 * integrates the pose, and clamps to the field bounds (kinematic drivetrain bound, R6).
 *
 * <p>Kinematic only — no contact forces or rigid-body physics (R6). Geometry comes from the season
 * {@link DrivetrainSimConfig}; the core hard-codes no season numbers.
 *
 * <p>Wheel order is [frontLeft, frontRight, backLeft, backRight].
 *
 * <p><b>The frame is the localizer frame, not the field frame</b> (conventions §7): {@code +x} forward
 * at heading 0, {@code +y} left, heading CCW-positive, radians, inches. That is the frame a dead-wheel
 * odometry device reports, and this class integrates in it because in a real robot such a device is what
 * feeds the same numbers. It is <b>ninety degrees from the field frame</b> that game pieces and trigger
 * volumes are placed in ({@code +X} right, {@code +Y} forward). Rotate with
 * {@link org.horizon36596.simloop.field.FieldFrameTransform} before asking a field question of a pose
 * from here; passing one straight across is wrong in a way that still looks plausible (BACKLOG B37).

     *
     * <p>This is the mecanum's roller slip, and it is the one place this integrator stops being pure
     * geometry. The forward-kinematics sum below says what the wheels are <i>asking</i> the chassis to do
     * sideways; this factor says how much of that ask the rollers deliver. 1.0 means a robot that strafes
     * exactly as fast as it drives, which is what this class assumed before the factor existed.
     *
     * <p>It multiplies <b>only</b> the lateral velocity. Forward speed and rotation are unaffected, because
     * both are produced by the wheels rolling in their primary direction, where nothing slips.
     *
     * <p><b>This is not a friction model, and the drivetrain stays kinematic (domain R6).</b> Worth saying
     * plainly, because the words "slip" and "rollers" invite the opposite reading. Nothing here computes a
     * force, a normal load, or a contact patch: it is one measured constant, fixed for the life of the
     * object, multiplied once per tick — the same kind of thing as the top-speed ceiling the config already
     * supplies. If a future change wants slip that varies with load, speed or surface, that is rigid-body
     * physics and R6 says to stop and flag it rather than write it here.
