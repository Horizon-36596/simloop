/**
 * Closes the sim odometry loop for a mecanum drivetrain (fakehardware-plant §5): each tick it reads the
 * four drive {@link FakeMotor}s' modelled wheel velocities and integrates the pose through
 * {@link MecanumPoseIntegrator}. Because the season drivetrain's inverse kinematics (which commanded the
 * motor powers) and this forward-kinematics integrator share the {@code [frontLeft, frontRight, backLeft,
 * backRight]} wheel order and convention (B1-M1 — IK is the exact inverse of this FK), a forward chassis
 * command drives the pose forward: the sim odometry is self-consistent with what was commanded.
 *
 * <p>Season-agnostic core: it depends only on {@link FakeMotor} + {@link DrivetrainSimConfig}. The glue
 * that exposes this pose through the season's odometry device (e.g. an OctoQuad fake) lives in the season
 * layer (domain R7). Deterministic: state changes only in {@link #update(double)}; getters are pure reads.
 *
 * <p><b>The pose is in the localizer frame</b> ({@code +x} forward at heading 0, {@code +y} left), which
 * is ninety degrees from the field frame that {@code org.horizon36596.simloop.field} places game pieces
 * and trigger volumes in. Both are deliberate (conventions §7). Rotate with
 * {@link org.horizon36596.simloop.field.FieldFrameTransform} at the boundary; a pose passed across
 * unrotated puts the robot somewhere plausible, facing the wrong way (BACKLOG B37).
