/**
 * A rectangular region bolted to the robot that decides whether a game piece is close enough to be
 * acquired — the "mouth" of an intake, expressed as geometry instead of contact physics (domain R6).
 *
 * <p><b>Why a rectangle on the floor and not a 3-D volume.</b> Acquisition happens where a mechanism
 * meets a piece lying on the field, so the only question this class has to answer is a footprint
 * question: is the piece within the mouth's rectangle. Modelling height would only matter if pieces could
 * be knocked, stacked, or dropped, and R6 rules that class of physics out. The name says "volume" because
 * that is the term the project uses for the concept; the geometry is deliberately 2-D and the sim has no
 * Z axis for pieces.
 *
 * <p><b>Robot frame and units — read this before writing one down.</b> The rectangle is defined in the
 * robot's own frame in inches, using the two directions a person naturally describes a robot with:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>forward</b> — the way the robot drives when both sticks go up. {@code forwardOffsetInches} is
 *       positive toward the front bumper, negative toward the back.</li>
 *   <li><b>left</b> — the driver's left when standing behind the robot. {@code leftOffsetInches} is
 *       positive toward the left side, negative toward the right.</li>
 * </ul>
 * {@code depthInches} is the rectangle's extent along forward and {@code widthInches} its extent along
 * left, both full extents rather than half-extents. So an intake mouth spanning the whole front of an
 * 18 in robot, reaching 6 in out ahead of the frame's centre, is
 * {@code new TriggerVolume("intake", 8.0, 0.0, 6.0, 16.0)}.
 *
 * <p><b>Field frame it is tested against.</b> {@link #overlapsPiece} takes the robot's pose in the repo's
 * FTC-Cartesian field frame (+X right, +Y forward, centre origin, inches, heading CCW-positive with the
 * robot's forward direction being {@code (cos heading, sin heading)} — conventions §7), rotates the piece
 * into the robot frame, and does one circle-versus-rectangle test. The field frame and the localizer
 * frame share the field's centre origin, so converting between those two is a rotation with no
 * translation; the robot frame this method rotates into is centred on the robot, so getting into it is a
 * translation and then a rotation.
 *
 * <p><b>A drivetrain pose is not in that frame.</b> {@code MecanumDrivePlant} and
 * {@code MecanumPoseIntegrator} report the localizer frame (+x forward, +y left), which is ninety
 * degrees from the field frame this method wants. Handing one straight in gives a plausible-looking
 * wrong answer rather than an error, so rotate it first with
 * {@link FieldFrameTransform#fieldXFromLocalizer}, {@link FieldFrameTransform#fieldYFromLocalizer} and
 * {@link FieldFrameTransform#fieldHeadingFromLocalizer}.
 *
 * <p>Immutable and pure: nothing here holds state, reads a clock, or allocates per call, so the same
 * inputs give the same answer on replay (domain R5) and season-agnostic core stays season-agnostic
 * (domain R7) — this class does not know what a piece is for.
